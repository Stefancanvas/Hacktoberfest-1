# ‚ùì What's Hacktoberfest 2020?

Hacktoberfest is the easiest way to get into open source! Hacktoberfest is a month-long festival of open source code presented by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [DEV](https://www.dev.to/) this year in 2020.

During the entire month of October 2020, all you have to do is contribute to any open-source projects and open at least 4 pull requests. Yes, any project and any kind of contributions. It can be a bug fix, improvement, or even a documentation change! And win a T-Shirt and awesome stickers.

If you‚Äôve never contributed to open source before, this is the perfect time to get started because Hacktoberfest provides a large list of available contribution opportunities (and yes, there are always plenty for beginners too).
